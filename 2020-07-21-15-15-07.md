curses_variables(3NCURSES)   curses_variables(3NCURSES)



NAME
   COLORS, COLOR_PAIRS, COLS, ESCDELAY, LINES, TABSIZE,
   curscr, newscr, stdscr - curses global variables

SYNOPSIS
   #include <curses.h>

   int COLOR_PAIRS;
   int COLORS;
   int COLS;
   int ESCDELAY;
   int LINES;
   int TABSIZE;
   WINDOW * curscr;
   WINDOW * newscr;
   WINDOW * stdscr;

DESCRIPTION
   This page summarizes variables provided by the
   curses library.  A more complete description is
   given in the curses(3X) manual page.

   Depending on the configuration, these may be actual
   variables, or macros (see threads(3NCURSES) and
   opaque(3NCURSES)) which provide read-only access to
   curses's state.  In either case, applications should
   treat them as read-only to avoid confusing the
   library.

   COLOR_PAIRS
   After initializing curses, this variable contains
   the number of color pairs which the terminal can
   support.  Usually the number of color pairs will be
   the product COLORS*COLORS, however this is not
   always true:

   o   a few terminals use HLS colors, which do not
       follow this rule

   o   terminals supporting a large number of colors
       are limited by the number of color pairs that
       can be represented in a signed short value.
